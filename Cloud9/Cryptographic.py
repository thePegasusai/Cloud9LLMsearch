# Here's an example of how you can use the cryptography library to create an AWS credential encryption file:

import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC

def encrypt_credentials(password: str, credentials: dict):
    # Generate a key from the provided password
    salt = os.urandom(16)
    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256,
        length=32,
        salt=salt,
        iterations=100000,
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password))
    f = Fernet(key)

    # Encrypt the credentials
    credentials_bytes = str(credentials).encode()
    encrypted_credentials = f.encrypt(credentials_bytes)

    # Save the encrypted credentials and the salt to a file
    with open("encrypted_credentials.bin", "wb") as f:
        f.write(salt)
        f.write(encrypted_credentials)
    print("Credentials encrypted and saved to 'encrypted_credentials.bin'.")

# Example usage
credentials = {
    'access_key': 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    'secret_key': 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
}
password = input("Enter a password to encrypt the credentials: ")
encrypt_credentials(password, credentials)

# This example will encrypt the credentials dictionary with a password provided by the user. Then it will save the encrypted credentials and the salt used to encrypt the data to a binary file named "encrypted_credentials.bin".
It is recommended to use a strong password and store the encrypted credentials file in a secure location.
Also, it's important to use IAM roles and least privilege access to limit the permission of the application to access only the necessary services and resources to prevent security breaches.
