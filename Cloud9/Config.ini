# You can store your AWS credentials in a configuration file and then use that file to supply your credentials to the different modules in your program. One way to do this is to use the configparser module to create a configuration file that can be read by your program.

Here is an example of how you can create an AWS config file, config.ini, that stores your AWS credentials:

[AWS]
access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read('config.ini')

access_key = config['AWS']['access_key']
secret_key = config['AWS']['secret_key']

s3 = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id=access_key,
    aws_secret_access_key=secret_key)



# Additionally, you can also use IAM roles to give your application permission to access AWS services. This way you don't have to use access key and secret key in your application.

It is recommended to encrypt the credentials file and store it in a safe place. Also, it's important to use IAM roles and least privilege access to limit the permission of the application to access only the necessary services and resources to prevent security breaches.
